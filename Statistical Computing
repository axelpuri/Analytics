/*Use a t test to determine whether there is a difference in the average length of plastic between the Neuston 
and Manta net types. Use α=0.02.
Before a ttest can be used to determine the difference in the average length of plastic between the Neuston 
and Manta net types, we need to join several tables together using join conditions. 

The objective is to use the plastics table as the main base that has all the lengths of the plastics variable table to 
match with the dates from the replciates table when the tow was undertaken using a left join on netstation and replicates. 
This combined set will then be joined with the vessels table which has details about manta and neuton nettypes using a 
left join on dates. This means whenever the non key attributes (nettype) will populate into the joined table whenever 
there is a matching date with the left (first) combined table of plastics and replicates. */

contain crystals :Source wikipedia) and driftwood  as 3 which can be later recoded as mixed (Driftwood is wood that has been washed onto 
a shore or beach of a sea, lake, or river by the action of winds, tides or waves. There is also a subset of driftwood known as drift lumber.
